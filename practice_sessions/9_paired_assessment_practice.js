let students = {
  'beans': [89, 90, 76, 57, 67], //379
  'farts': [90, 94, 98, 67, 88], // 437
  'butts': [40, 94, 98, 79, 98], // 409
  'cake': [90, 94, 98, 68, 88], // 438
};

//part 1
//return a string of the student's name and average score 
//for example:
//beans has an average score of 75.8

//part 2
//refactor the function so that it can take in an array of student names and return the average score for each student - can return strings or an array

//for example:
  //[beans, butts, farts]
  //beans has an average score of 75.8
  //butts has an average score of 81.8
  //farts has an average score of 87.4




  // For each student name
  // - set average to zero
  // - sum their grades
  // - divide their sum by the number of their grades
